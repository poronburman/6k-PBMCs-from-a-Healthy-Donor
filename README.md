# Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis

This project re-analyzes the publicly available 10X Genomics Single Cell RNA Sequencing dataset, which can be found at https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc3k.    

Perpheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a healthy donor, library preparation was performed on the 10X Genomics platform, and sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.

Having a look at the UMI counts, it seems that the number of features are mostly between 2000 and 200 and that 5% of the UMI counts map to the mitochondrial RNA.
