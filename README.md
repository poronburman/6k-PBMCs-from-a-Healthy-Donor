# Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis

This project analyzes Single Cell Gene Expression dataset, downloaded from the 10X Genomics dataset https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/pbmc6k? 

Analyses for this dataset was adapted from Seurat's Guided Clustering Tutorial https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/pbmc3k_tutorial.html

5,400 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells were isolated from a healthy donor. These cells were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform, with ~28,000 reads sequenced per cell.
